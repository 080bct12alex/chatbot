a simple chatbot capable of remembering conversation history

# About This Simple Chatbot

This simple chatbot is designed to simulate a conversation where the user can interact by typing messages. At this stage, the chatbot is set up with a basic skeleton that allows it to respond to user input, but it doesn't yet include the loop that would allow for continuous chatting.

## Current Features:

- The chatbot prompts the user to type a message, which is captured into a variable.
- After receiving the message, the chatbot processes it and provides a simple response (this can be expanded for more complex interactions in the future).
- The program currently runs once: after receiving a single user input, it responds and then finishes the interaction.  (not feel like chatbot)

## Next Steps:

To make the chatbot more interactive(feel like chatbot), the next step is to implement a **while loop**. This loop will keep the conversation going, asking for new user input and responding accordingly, until the user types "exit" or "quit" to end the chat.

## Future Improvements:

- **Continuous Chat Feature:** By adding the loop, the chatbot will support ongoing conversations, allowing users to chat freely without restarting the program each time.
- **Enhanced Responses:** The chatbot will be able to respond more intelligently to a wider range of inputs, improving its conversational feel.
- **Document Analysis for Accurate Answers (RAG):** The chatbot will integrate **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, allowing it to fetch relevant information from documents and databases to provide more accurate and contextually appropriate answers.
- **Actionable Tools:** The chatbot will include various tools for executing actions, such as setting reminders, searching the web, or processing requests beyond simple responses.
- **User Interface (UI):** A user-friendly interface will be developed, allowing for smoother interaction and better overall experience.
- **LangSmith Integration:** Future versions will integrate **LangSmith**, a tool that enhances the chatbot's capabilities by incorporating more sophisticated NLP techniques and improving conversation quality.
- **Advanced Lang Graph Concepts:** This will explore advanced concepts in **Lang Graph** by implementing memory, persistence, and check pointers to improve the chatbot’s ability to recall previous conversations, maintain context, and ensure more dynamic responses.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** The chatbot will eventually include **Human-in-the-Loop** features to allow for human intervention in complex or uncertain cases, improving the chatbot’s accuracy and reliability.
- **Fault Tolerance:** To ensure robustness, fault tolerance will be built in so that the chatbot can gracefully handle errors or unexpected inputs without crashing.
- **Gradual Complexity:** The chatbot’s complexity will gradually increase by incorporating machine learning algorithms, self-improvement features, and better conversational models to provide a richer, more engaging user experience.

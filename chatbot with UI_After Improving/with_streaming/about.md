## Chatbot Development
After previous enhancements like adding short-term memory and UI in developing a chatbot. 

Their is a problem where the chatbot takes too long to respond when asked for lengthy outputs, causing delays of several seconds before displaying the complete response. This issue highlights the need for improvements in how the chatbot handles and streams long replies.

## Solution
    Streaming Feature
Implementing streaming in a chatbot enhances user experience by displaying output in a typewriter fashion, showing responses token by token rather than all at once. 
This approach improves readability and reduces wait time as users see results unfold gradually. 

## Importance of Streaming
Streaming enhances user experience in LLM applications by providing faster response times, making interactions feel more human-like and engaging. It facilitates clearer understanding of complex outputs, such as code, by displaying results gradually. Additionally, streaming allows for real-time updates during processes, improving overall usability and preventing user uncertainty.  It helps to save tokens by stopping the generation in middle if we don't like the output generating or we already get the required answer. 

## Implementing Streaming
To implement streaming in your chatbot, simply replace the graph.invoke function with the dot.stream function, which returns a generator object. You'll loop over this generator to print token by token output, using the yield keyword in your functions. In the front-end code using Streamlit, utilize st.write_stream to seamlessly handle the UI for streaming the chatbot responses.

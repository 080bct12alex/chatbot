## Improvement (Almost Final)

### **Logical Conversation Names**
Give a **logical names** to the conversation on the UI rather than displaying  thread  IDs as it happens in ChatGPT.
This  enhance the user experience and make conversations easier to identify.

### **Login/Logout for Per User**
Enable users to log in and log out, providing personalized experiences and secure access to the platform.

### **Cookies for Persistent Login**
Implement cookies to ensure users remain logged in across sessions, offering convenience and reducing the need to re-login every time.

### **Max AI Usage Per User Per Day**
Introduce a daily usage limit for each user to prevent overuse and ensure fair access for all. This can be tied to account tiers or premium plans.
